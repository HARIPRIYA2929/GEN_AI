1.Agent-Based Processing (agent.py)

Defines autonomous AI agents for handling tasks like prompt parsing, decision-making, and output generation.

2.Core Execution Workflow (main.py)

Serves as the engine tying together agents, data processing, and user inputs to run end-to-end pipelines.

3.Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (rag.py, rag1.py)

Integrates external knowledge sources to enrich AI outputs through context retrieval and semantic search.

4.Multi-Modal Image Handling (multiimage.py)

Supports processing and generating insights from multiple imagesâ€”ideal for use cases like image annotation, description, or analysis.

5.Interactive Interface (streamlit_app.py)

Launches a user-friendly web app using Streamlit to test models in real time, visualize outputs, and iterate quickly.

6.Visual Insights (agent.png, graph.png)

Includes visual assets likely representing agent workflows, system architecture, or output visualization (e.g., performance graphs or flowcharts).

7.Dependency Management

Two requirements files (requirements.txt, reuirements1.txt) suggest separation between core and optional dependencies, aiding lightweight installs or modular usage.
